# Next steps for this project 


1. Follow the rest of this https://letsbuildui.dev/articles/building-an-audio-player-with-react-hooks (currently on Controls Component header) also this https://codesandbox.io/s/react-audio-player-demo-zwhoc?file=/src/styles.css
1. Deal with my data and images and such, test whether paths work alright or if I need to import things differently? (make a script for importing)
1. Curate a music library from here https://www.storyblocks.com/audio/search/rain and https://pixabay.com/music/
